title: What's the differences between software developer and architecter?
---

Today I ask my CTO a question:
  What's the differences between software developer and architecter?

My traditional understand about architecter is those senior technical guys who decide what skill to use during the projects and help partition the project into several modules and then assign these modules to each team or developer.

A architecter should decide important parameters and the architect the project used.

However, my CTO gives me an important additional traits of architecter:
  An architecter should be the best developer.
  Only when he is the best developer, he can know which skill set should the best choice.
  And most important, when the below developers has jump into the wrong way to develop, he can help they to go back to the correct way and solve some roadblocks due to he is the best developer.
  If you don't know the details of development, you proberbly cannot help a lot to the team.

I do approve his opinion.
